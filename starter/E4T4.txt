# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Move the web service instance to a private subnet so it is not exposed to the internet.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
The VPC endpoint will make it so access to S3 does not leave our VPC, however it depends where the users of the secrets buckets are.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. Objects that are writen to the bucket after enabling encryption are encrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
They would reset the changes made manually. For example the bucket encryption setting would be reset.
