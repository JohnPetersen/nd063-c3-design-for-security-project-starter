# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

Change 1
Disable password authentication for SSH. We are using keys for authentication.

Change 2
Move the web service instance to the private subnet and use either a bastion host or System Manager to access it. 

Change 3
If possible make the web service instance immutable and turn off SSH access entirely.


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
In the c3-app.yml CloudFormation script specify only the free recipe bucket rather than '*' for the instance role policy resource.
